** TODO Change this import to have a better package name

[[file:~/Workspace/github.com/BenDHarvey/bloomsprout-enviroplus-logger/bloomsprout/parse.py::from compiled.python import bloomsprout_proto_pb2]]

We are importing this package from the proto git repo at github.com/bendharvey/bloomsprout-proto. The name is a little funky and it exporting a funky package name. Have a look at getting this to be a little more user friendly. Import should look something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from bloomsprout_proto import bloomsprout_proto_pb2
#+END_SRC

The above is an example of what it could look like
** DONE Fix this

[[file:~/Workspace/github.com/BenDHarvey/bloomsprout-enviroplus-logger/bloomsprout/parse.py::print("\[Warning\] parse_name_to_proto_enum - return value is set to 0")]]

Change to have a proper logging call and not just a print statement
** TODO Fix this

[[file:~/Workspace/github.com/BenDHarvey/bloomsprout-enviroplus-logger/bloomsprout/parse.py::reading.deviceName = "sense-02" # TODO: Fix me]]

Should get this value from environment variable instead of hard coded
