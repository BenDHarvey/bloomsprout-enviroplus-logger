* Enviro hat logger

This repo has been simplified somewhat from its original form. It is directly using python script and pushing the results from the envioo+ hat sensors to mqtt broker. Ansible is being used to setup the service on the device.

There are some manual steps required to setup a new device ready to run the python scripts.

Scripts for setting up a new device can be found in github https://github.com/pimoroni/enviroplus-python . The single line command is also below
